      I use [Mathematica](http://wolfram.com) for most of our technology development
  
      If you are interested in a bridge between [Mathematica](http://wolfram.com) and [Interactive Brokers ](http://interactivebrokers.com) please contact me for a reasonably priced solution or a free trial. Sample mathematica code is shown below:
      
          ibConnection = ibFiconabSimpleWrapper[]; 
          ibAccountValueHash = {}; 
          ibAccountPortfolioHash = {}; 
          ibOrderHash = {}; 
          orderId = ibPlaceCompleteOrder[ibConnection, "GM", "STK", "BUY", 250, "LMT", 33.2, accountName, "algoName"]
      
  
      I also use [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) for website and integrated performance reporting.  Most of our reporting and database tools are hosed on Amazon.com services including Amazon's RDS and EC2 services.
