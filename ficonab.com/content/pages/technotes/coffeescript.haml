      %h1 Compile coffeescript to javascript

      %p On my mac compiling coffeescript to javascript was not self evident.  I did it by entering rails console and then running the following commands

      %pre
        %code 
          res=CoffeeScript.compile File.read("application.coffee")
          File.open('application.js', 'w') { |file| file.write(res) }
