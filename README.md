# These are the public websites for estorm and ficonab
They use nesta cms as a basic platform and haml for markdown.
There is some interesting haml code if you take a look through the pages to manage menus etc.

There is a travis job running to validate the sites on every commit.  The travis job runs the commands in two subdirectories which may be of use to someone to review.
